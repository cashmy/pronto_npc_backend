### **ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)**
1.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Your ONLY output will be a series of diffs in the unified format, one for each modified file. Do NOT write any other text, explanation, or greeting. Each diff for each file must start with its own `--- a/path/to/file` and `+++ b/path/to/file` header.
2.  **PRECISION:** The context lines in the diff (lines not starting with '+' or '-') MUST be an EXACT, character-for-character copy of the original file. Do NOT alter whitespace or any other characters on these lines.
3.  **TASK FOCUS:** Your ONLY task is to INSERT documentation (docstrings and schemas) into the existing code. Do NOT refactor or change any existing code logic.

### **ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)**
1.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Your ONLY output will be a series of diffs in the unified format. Each modified file must have its own separate diff block. Do NOT write any other text, explanation, or greeting.

    **Correct Example:**
    ```diff
    --- a/path/to/file1.py
    +++ b/path/to/file1.py
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -old content
    +new content
    ```
    ```diff
    --- a/path/to/file2.py
    +++ b/path/to/file2.py
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -old content
    +new content
2.  **PRECISION:** The context lines in the diff (lines not starting with '+' or '-') MUST be an EXACT, character-for-character copy of the original file. Do NOT alter whitespace or any other characters on these lines.

### **YOUR TASK**
Your task is to add documentation to the Python files of an existing Django app, following our project's standards. This involves adding Google-style docstrings and `drf-spectacular` schemas.

---

### **Documentation Rules**

Follow these specific rules for each file type within the target module.

**1. For `models.py` files:**
*   **Class Docstring:** Insert a concise summary and a detailed paragraph.
*   **Field Docstrings:** Insert a short docstring on the line immediately following *every* field definition.
*   **Method Docstrings:** Insert a full Google-style docstring for all methods.
*   **Meta Class:** Insert a simple one-line docstring.

**2. For `serializers.py` files:**
*   **Class Docstring:** Insert a concise summary, a detailed paragraph, and a comprehensive `Attributes:` list.
*   **Meta Class:** Insert a simple one-line docstring.

**3. For `views.py` files (APIViews):**
*   **`@extend_schema`:** Insert this decorator above the function signature. It must include `tags`, `summary`, `description`, and `responses`.
*   **Function Docstring:** Insert a full Google-style docstring below the function signature.

### **Final Instruction**
Apply the documentation process detailed above to the Python files in the following module: `genre/`
Specifically the files of models.py, views.py, and serializers.py within the module.
