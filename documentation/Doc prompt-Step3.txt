### **ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)**
1.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Your ONLY output will be a series of diffs in the unified format, one for each modified file. Do NOT write any other text, explanation, or greeting.
2.  **PRECISION:** The context lines in the diff (lines not starting with '+' or '-') MUST be an EXACT, character-for-character copy of the original file.
3.  **TASK FOCUS:** Your ONLY task is to **MODIFY** existing `.rst` files to add new entries to the `toctree` directives. Do NOT create any new files or modify any other part of the files.

### **YOUR TASK**
Based on the files open in the editor, update the main `toctree` files (`models.rst`, `serializers.rst`, `views.rst`) to include the newly created documentation files for the `archetype` module.

You must ensure the final list in each `toctree` remains in alphabetical order.
